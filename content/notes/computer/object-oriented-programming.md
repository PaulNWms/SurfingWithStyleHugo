## Pillars of Object-Oriented Programming

- Abstraction
    - Class instances should hide implementation details
    - Users only need to have the interface
- Encapsulation
    - Class instances should group related data and methods
    - Hiding of data attributes which are only used for internal implementation purposes
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

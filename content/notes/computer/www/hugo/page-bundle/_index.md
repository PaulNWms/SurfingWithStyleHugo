Hugo has [Leaf Bundle](/study/factoids/computer/www/hugo/page-bundle/leaf-bundle)s, [[Branch Bundle]]s and [[Headless Bundle]]s.

A directory will generally have have an `_index.md` or `index.md` file, depending on context.
- If the page has assets that you want stored locally, it's a [Leaf Bundle](/study/factoids/computer/www/hugo/page-bundle/leaf-bundle) and will have `index.md` for that page, along with the assets.
- If there are multiple pages at that URL folder level it will have `_index.md`.
- If there are subfolders, it's a [branch bundle](/study/factoids/computer/www/hugo/page-bundle/branch-bundle) and will have `_index.md`.
- A [headless bundle](/study/factoids/computer/www/hugo/page-bundle/headless-bundle) is a page that exists as a place for shared assets.

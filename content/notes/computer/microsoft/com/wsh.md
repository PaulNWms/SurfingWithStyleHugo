Windows Scripting Host (WSH) is an administrative API accessible from scripting languages like VB6, JScript and PowerShell.

The WSH base objects have ProgIDs `WScript.Shell` and `WScript.Network`.

The WSH Runtime Library is housed in WSHOM.OCX.

The VB6 IDE had a browser for conveniently navigating WSH objects.  It's also accessible from PowerShell, but less discoverable.  PowerShell/.NET supersede or wrap most of its functionality.

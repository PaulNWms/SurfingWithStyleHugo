Windows DNA (Distributed Network Architecture) is a loosely-defined marketing term that includes an assortment of things.  It's designed to support a three-tier architecture - with data, business logic and presentation layers, like a website - but (mostly) in the COM world.

- Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS)
- Active Server Pages (ASP) - not to be confused with [ASP.NET](/notes/)
- ActiveX Data Objects (ADO)
- Microsoft Message Queuing ([MSMQ](/notes/))
- Active Directory (AD) - not to be confused with [Azure Active Directory](/notes/computer/microsoft/azure/identity-services/azure-active-directory)
- Internet Information Services (IIS)
- SQL Server

IIS and MSMQ are optional Windows features that are turned off by default.

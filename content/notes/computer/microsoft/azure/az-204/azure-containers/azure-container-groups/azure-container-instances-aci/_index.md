### Container
A bundle of software with custom code, an operating system (OS), and any libraries and dependencies required by the custom code. The bundle is stored and shared as a lightweight executable that can run on almost any infrastructure.

Benefits of Azure Container Instances (ACI)
- Fast startup
- Internet access to containers
- Hypervisor-level security comparable to a VM
- Minimized storage of customer data- Custom sizes
- Persistent storage via Azure Files
- Both Linux and Windows

Consider:
- Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for more advanced features and access to Kubernetes APIs
- Azure Container Apps for a more fully managed experience

Stored in the [Azure Container Registry (ACR)](/notes/computer/microsoft/azure/az-204/azure-containers/azure-container-groups/azure-container-instances-aci/azure-container-registry-acr)

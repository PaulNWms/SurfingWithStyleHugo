- Different skillset from AD to Azure AD.
- Every Azure account will have an Azure AD service.
- A [Tenant](/notes/computer/microsoft/azure/identity-services/azure-active-directory/tenant) is a dedicated instance of Azure AD. It represents your organization in Azure.
- A user can be a member or guest of up to 500 tenants.

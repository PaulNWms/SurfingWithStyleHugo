- Default Limit - Some Azure accounts with monthly credits to use will have default spending limits. When the credits are used, the limit kicks in. 
- No Increase - When the credits are gone, either remove the limit entirely or leave it in effect.
- No Spending Limit - Pay-as-you-go accounts have no spending limit functionality.

- IaaS
- Tools - [Azure Portal](/notes/)
- Compliance - [blueprints](/notes/)
- Recommendations
- Choose configuration - Pricing goes up as resources go up, and you pay by the hour.

Pros
- Control Use - virtual machines when you need to control all aspects of an environment or machine.
- Application - Install specific applications on your Windows or Linux machines.
- Existing Infrastructure - You can move existing resources and virtual machines to Azure from on-premises or another cloud provider.

Cons
- Not for Everything - If you can use another Azure service instead, it is often worth it.
- Maintenance - A lot of maintenance with VMs. Operating system updates, patches, security concerns.

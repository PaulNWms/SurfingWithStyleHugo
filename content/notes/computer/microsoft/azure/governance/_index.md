Governance keeps you compliant and out of trouble.

- [Azure Policy](/notes/) ensures that policies applied to resources are compliant.
- A [policy](/notes/) is a set of rules to ensure compliant resources.
- Role-based access control ([RBAC](/notes/computer/microsoft/azure/governance/rbac)) ensures user compliance through assigning a role to a user. A role is a combination of security principal, role definition and scope.
- [Locks](/notes/computer/microsoft/azure/governance/locks) make sure that subscriptions, resource groups or resources are either not modified or not deleted.
- [Blueprints](/notes/) are templates for creating standard Azure environments.
- The [Azure Advisor for Security Assistance](/notes/) is part of the Security Center.

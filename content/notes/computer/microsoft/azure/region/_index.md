A set of data centers that are close enough to each other that it doesnâ€™t matter which data center your data is in.

Each region is in a [Paired Region](/study/factoids/computer/microsoft/azure/region/paired-region).

Each region contains 3 or more [Availability Zones](/study/factoids/computer/microsoft/azure/region/availability-zones).

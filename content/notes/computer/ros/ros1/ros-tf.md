ROS tf (for transform) is a matrix package for converting x, y, z, roll, pitch, yaw from one coordinate space to another.  (tf is not to be confused with TensorFlow.)

tf is an built-in service.  Create a tf listener in your node, and behind the scenes it will subscribe to the /tf topic.  It will have access to a buffer of tf/tfMessage data published by other nodes.

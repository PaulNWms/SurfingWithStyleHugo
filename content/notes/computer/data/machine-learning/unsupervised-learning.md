In unsupervised learning, the training data is unlabelled.

Typical unsupervised learning tasks include
- clustering,
- visualization,
- dimensionality reduction / feature extraction,
- anomaly detection and
- association rule learning.

Some of the most important unsupervised learning algorithms include
- clustering
    - k-means
    - hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA)
    - expectation maximization
- visualization and dimensionality reduction
    - principle component analysis (PCA)
    - kernel PCA
    - locally-linear embedding (LLE)
    - t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE)
- association rule learning
    - Apriori
    - Eclat

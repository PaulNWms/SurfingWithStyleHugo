Commonly Mentioned Public Records (Including Voter and Property)

- Voter registration records  
    These are public in most states (searchable via state election offices or sites like Vote.org). They indicate U.S. citizenship (required to register) and residency, but no direct proof of legal immigration history—naturalized citizens appear the same as birthright citizens.
- Property records (deeds, tax assessments)  
    Available through county assessor/recorder offices or online portals (e.g., via county websites or aggregators like Zillow/Redfin for basic info). They show home ownership and residency duration, but anyone (regardless of status) can own property in most cases.

Other Potentially Useful Public RecordsThese are accessible to varying degrees (often online or via county/state offices) and might hint at ties to the U.S., though they're highly indirect and unreliable for proving legal status:

- Court records (civil, criminal, family, probate) → Searchable via state/county court websites or PACER (for federal). Appearances in lawsuits, divorces, or probate can indicate long-term presence. Naturalization ceremonies sometimes appear in older local court records (pre-1950s), searchable via National Archives or Ancestry.com (subscription).
- Driver's license or state ID records → Not public databases—privacy-protected. Some states mark licenses for non-citizens or limited status (e.g., "not for REAL ID"), but you can't search others' records as a private citizen.
- Professional/occupational licenses (e.g., nursing, real estate, teaching) → Many states have public lookup tools on licensing board websites (e.g., search by name). Some professions require proof of legal work authorization, so an active license might suggest eligibility, but not conclusive (requirements vary).
- Marriage licenses and divorce records → Public via county clerk offices or vital records departments. They show residency at the time of marriage but nothing about immigration.
- Birth/death records (for family members) → State vital records offices; often restricted but can indicate family ties/residency.
- Historical naturalization records → For pre-1956 naturalizations, duplicates at USCIS or National Archives (searchable online via Ancestry/FamilySearch or USCIS Genealogy Program for a fee). Useful only for older citizenship proof.

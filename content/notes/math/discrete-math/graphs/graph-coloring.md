Each map in the plane can be represented by a graph.  Each region of the map is represented by a vertex.  Edges connect two vertices if they have a common border.  This is called the _dual graph_ of the map.

A _coloring_ of a simple graph is the assignment of a color to each vertex of the graph so that no two adjacent vertices are assigned the same color.

The _chromatic number_ of a graph is the least number of colors needed for a coloring of this graph.

The **four color theorem** states that every planar graph can be colored using four or fewer colors.

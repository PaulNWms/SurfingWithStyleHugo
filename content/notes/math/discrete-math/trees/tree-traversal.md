## Traversal Algorithms

Depth-first traversal of an ordered rooted tree can be performed in a _preorder traversal_, an _inorder traversal_, or a _postorder traversal_.

When used to represent math expressions, these correspond to _prefix form_ (a.k.a. Polish notation), _infix form_, and _posfix form_ (a.k.a. reverse Polish notation).

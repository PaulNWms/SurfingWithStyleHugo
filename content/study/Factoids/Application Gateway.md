An application gateway is a higher level load balancer.

Distributes incoming traffic based on HTTP request properties, such as URL and host headers. Same session traffic can be handled by multiple servers.

- It works on the HTTP request of the traffic, instead of the IP address and port.
- Traffic from a specific web address can go to a specific machine.
- Is a fit for most other Azure services.
- Supports auto-scaling, end-to-end encryption, zone redundancy and multi-site hosting.

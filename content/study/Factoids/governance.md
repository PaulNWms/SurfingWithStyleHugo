Governance keeps you compliant and out of trouble.

- [Azure Policy](../azure-policy/) ensures that policies applied to resources are compliant.
- A [policy](../policy/) is a set of rules to ensure compliant resources.
- Role-based access control ([RBAC](../rbac/)) ensures user compliance through assigning a role to a user. A role is a combination of security principal, role definition and scope.
- [Locks](../locks/) make sure that subscriptions, resource groups or resources are either not modified or not deleted.
- [Blueprints](../blueprints/) are templates for creating standard Azure environments.
- The [Azure Advisor for Security Assistance](../azure-advisor-for-security-assistance/) is part of the Security Center.

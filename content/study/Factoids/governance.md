Governance keeps you compliant and out of trouble.

- [[Azure Policy]] ensures that policies applied to resources are compliant.
- A [[policy]] is a set of rules to ensure compliant resources.
- Role-based access control ([[RBAC]]) ensures user compliance through assigning a role to a user. A role is a combination of security principal, role definition and scope.
- [[Locks]] make sure that subscriptions, resource groups or resources are either not modified or not deleted.
- [[Blueprints]] are templates for creating standard Azure environments.
- The [[Azure Advisor for Security Assistance]] is part of the Security Center.

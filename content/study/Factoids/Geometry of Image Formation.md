### Pinhole camera

The [focal length](../focal-length/) is the distance from the pinhole to the [image plane](../image-plane/).  The size of the projected image $(x,y)$ is related by the focal length $f$ and the distance to the pinhole $Z$.

$$x = f*\frac{X}{Z}$$

$$y = f*\frac{Y}{Z}$$

Rays captured by a lens converge on a [focal plane](../focal-plane/).  The distance from the lens to the [image plane](../image-plane/) is twice the distance from the lens to the focal plane.

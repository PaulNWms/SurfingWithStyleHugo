- Confidence - Critical to ensure confidence in the uptime and reliability of services.
- Contract - Contract between you and Azure stating Microsoftâ€™s commitment for uptime and connectivity.
- Complex - SLAs can have various levels depending on the number and variety of services, which region you use, and much more.
- Mandatory - If you have an Azure account, the various SLAs apply. No SLAs for free products and services.
- Multiple SLAs - There are many SLAs in Azure. Generally, 1 SLA per product. You automatically use the SLA for the service you use.
- Improve SLA - Having a backup of a service or resource, such as a VM in an availability set, can provide a better SLA.

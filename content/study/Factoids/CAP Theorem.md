In a distributed database, we can simultaneously have at most 2 of the 3 CAP properties.

- Consistency - Every read receives the most recent write or error.
- Availability - Every request gets a (non-error) response.
- Partition tolerance - The system continues to operate despite an arbitrary number of messages being dropped or delayed by the network between nodes.
